# Rényi Fair Inference
This repository is the basic implementation of Rényi fair K-means and logistic regression algorithms, introduced in [Rényi Fair Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12005). A more efficient scalable implementation can be found in the FERMI Repository [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12586.pdf) [code](https://github.com/optimization-for-data-driven-science/FERMI).
